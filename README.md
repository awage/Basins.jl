Basins.jl 
=========

This Julia package computes basins of attraction of dynamical systems in the phase plane. 
The algorithm computes the basin without prior knowledge of the attractors. 

The package provides also different metrics based on the basins of attraction:

- Uncertainty exponent
- Basin entropy
- Wada detection

 
Usage 
=====

First define a dynamical system on the plane, for example with a stroboscopic map or Poincar√© section.
